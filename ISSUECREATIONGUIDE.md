# Issue Creation Guide

When creating issues for our project, we ask that you follow our guidelines to ensure that the issue is clear, concise, and actionable. Here's a guide on how to do it:

## Title

Choose a title that summarizes the issue. It should be concise yet descriptive.

## Description

Provide a detailed description of the issue. Explain what the problem is, how it affects the project, and what you expect the outcome to be. If possible, include steps to reproduce the issue.

## Details

- **Problem:** Describe the problem in detail. What is happening, and what should happen instead?
- **Reproduction Steps:** If applicable, provide a list of steps to reproduce the problem.
- **Environment:** Describe the environment where the problem occurs (e.g., production, staging, development, etc.).
- **Screenshots:** If applicable, add screenshots to help explain the issue.
- **Code Snippets:** If the issue is related to a specific part of the code, include a snippet or link to the relevant file.

## Acceptance Criteria

List the criteria that will meet the requirement of the issue. This could be a checklist of things that need to be done to consider this issue closed.

## Labels and Assignees

Use labels to categorize the issue. This helps the team prioritize and assign issues more effectively. If you know who should handle the issue, assign it to them. Otherwise, leave it unassigned.

## Remember, the more information you provide, the easier it will be for the team to understand and address the issue. Thank you for your contributions!
