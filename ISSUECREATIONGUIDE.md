# Issue Creation Guide

In the grand symphony of collaboration that is our project, every issue plays a vital note. Each issue is like a conversation starter, a spark that can ignite a flurry of activity leading to improved code, new features, or resolved bugs. And it's contributors like you who are the musicians in this orchestra, the ones who breathe life into the score that is our project.

When creating issues for our project, we kindly ask that you follow our guidelines. These guidelines ensure that every issue is clear, concise, and actionable, serving as a productive catalyst for our project's progress.

## Title

The title of your issue is like the headline of a news article. It should be concise yet descriptive, giving a quick overview of the issue. Think of it as the subject line of an email - it should summarize the issue in a few words.

## Description

The description is where you can provide a detailed account of the issue. Explain what the problem is, how it affects the project, and what you expect the outcome to be. This is like the body of an email - it's where you can provide all the details.

## Details

- **Problem:** Describe the problem in detail. What is happening, and what should happen instead? This is like diagnosing a patient - you need to clearly identify the symptoms and the desired state of health.
- **Reproduction Steps:** If applicable, provide a list of steps to reproduce the problem. This is like a recipe - it should allow anyone to recreate the issue by following the steps.
- **Environment:** Describe the environment where the problem occurs (e.g., production, staging, development, etc.). This is like the setting of a story - it provides context for the issue.
- **Screenshots:** If applicable, add screenshots to help explain the issue. A picture is worth a thousand words, and screenshots can often explain a problem better than text alone.
- **Code Snippets:** If the issue is related to a specific part of the code, include a snippet or link to the relevant file. This is like providing a map - it shows exactly where the problem is located.

## Acceptance Criteria

List the criteria that will meet the requirement of the issue. This could be a checklist of things that need to be done to consider this issue closed. This is like a to-do list - it outlines all the tasks that need to be completed to resolve the issue.

## Labels and Assignees

Use labels to categorize the issue. This helps the team prioritize and assign issues more effectively. If you know who should handle the issue, assign it to them. Otherwise, leave it unassigned. This is like addressing a letter - it ensures that the issue gets to the right person or team.

Remember, the more information you provide, the easier it will be for the team to understand and address the issue. Your contributions, whether they're code, bug reports, feature suggestions, or anything else, are greatly valued by us. Thank you for your help!
